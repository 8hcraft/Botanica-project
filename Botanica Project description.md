# Botanica-project

Botanica is an ultimate update for Gotchiverse, with the unique gameplay and Alchemica utility sinks.

TL;DR

Mechanics of Botanica project implementation and its benefits to Gotchiverse:

* Alchemica sink - Your gotchi is coming to the Seed or Tree, to fulfill the needs of your Seed or Tree (daily required alchemica price); 
* Reversed channeling process - While spending alchemica on feeding, Gotchis also burns its channeling ability until the reset time, by interacting with Trees. 
(This kind of action does not burn gotchi kinship\aka legacy channeling rule\. This kind of action does not give you any alchemica, your channeling ability burnt + alchemica spent.);
* Tree feeding process is acting the same way as Gotchis resetting channeling ability = Your tree can be fed anytime in 24 hrs;
* Tree feeding timer gets a reset at the same time as gotchis getting channeling ability reset, 00.00 UTC;
* Each growing stage of Seed to become a Timeless Tree, will require different amounts of alchemica and times of being fed (depends on the stage and types of Trees), that needs to be spent on the Tree;
* These kind actions are going to fill up the growing process bar which is const in "tree rings";
* By doing so, your **Gotchi Gardener gaining Gardening skill**;
* Gardening skill will give you a discount on the cost of growth and increase your odds on successful reward claims. 

**I. What is Botanica?**

Botanica is the science of *Plants*.
Plants are everything that grows from the soil - ***Trees** , herbs, fruits and berries, veggies and mushrooms*.

(**Trees** will become our MVP in the upcoming series of Gotchiverse Botanica updates.)

All kinds of plants are grown on your parcel - your parcel is your garden itself.  
In the future we might go beyond the borders of our parcels and embellish entire Gotchiverse and it's streets.

Size of the Seed = size of the Tree (Seed=Tree).  
Trees and Seed are commonly 2x2 sized installations, but it all depends on the type of Seeds\Trees.  

**II. Botanica distribution**

All types of Botanica will be grown from the Seeds.  
Initially Seeds will come through "Genesis cones" distribution events. 

Botanica distribution:

Botanica will be distributed via Genesis cones distribution event.  
Genesis cones will be airdropped to all of the holders of the main assets, such as gotchis and parcels. 

Proportions of distribution per asset will be announced later.  
All Genesis cones will have even odds for a success to obtain seeds.

**III. Tiles utilities for planting Seeds**

In order to start the growing process your Seeds must be planted on the parcel. 

Seed must be in your *gotchi pocket*, that you can deposit through the Aavegotchi protocol from your wallet. 

In Gotchiverse, seed will appear in your **Building mode** same as any installation.

To start growing your Seeds, your **parcel** must to **have** any kind of **tile covering its surface**, to work as a soiled surface for the Seed and the future Tree.  
Before placing the Seed on the tile, think wisely, because after you place the seed on it, the tile will lose its ability to be moved (seed is "glued" to it).

**IV. Infinity items of Maal**

For those who don't have any tiles, we are proposing to make new, unlimited supply, non-bazaar tradable Soil tiles that will be always on sale in the DAO Maal (1x1 "Soil" tiles price 0.01 ghst).  

Since it's impossible to move or unequip planted Seed or Tree that has been placed on the tiled parcel, you need **Gardening instruments** in order to regain access to your tiles.  

There are only two ways to get your tiles back:

1) Seed or Tree demolition;   
2) Excavation of seed or tree.After demolishing the Seed or the Tree and its roots, you will be able to do anything with the tile underneath.  

If destruction of the plant is not an option, you can buy "shiny shovel" and "Pair of gloves" in the maal in order to dig it up, and to move it, you have to get "wheelbarrow".  
After all of the excavations, you still have to remove the roots, in order to gain access to your tile underneath.  

Each of the Maal **Gardening instruments** have 1 time use per action and after using it, it will be destroyed (nft burned).

List of the proposed instruments for Gardening:

* Pair of gloves - Item that's needed for any kind of earthworks;  
* Forest Axe - Axe that can cut down the grown tree;  
* Midget pickaxe - Instrument that is used to destroy the seed;  
* Light shovel - Excavation tool to dig out the Seed(or Shrubs in the future);  
* Shiny shovel - Excavation tool to dig out the Tree or Stump;  
* Roots remover - Roots removing tool of grown seeds, sprouts and saplings after it's excavations;  
* Grubber - Heavy tool to remove roots of grown Trees or Stumps after its excavations;  
* Rake - Useful thing in case of recent earthworks;  
* Wheelbarrow - needed in order to move your plants around your parcels freely after growing them;  
* Soil - New 1x1 fully brown tile to cover the surface under the tree. Soil tile will be consumed after placing seed or tree on it;  
* Sulfuric acid - No need to use Grubber and Shovels, this thing will get rid of anything that you grow on the Tile, but this item also will give forbid you to grow or build anything on it's cells for a period of time;  
* Bug spray - Get rid of these bugs, now!;  
* Pruner - Usefull thing if you want to take care of your tree and planning to make some Bonsai;  
* Pot - Simple pot that's needed for Bonsai to live forever;  
* Lightning rod - Protects your tree from 1 lightning strike;  
* Harvesting multitool - Mega knife that has everything inside of it for harvesting and seed extraction procedures;  
* Custom tree skins that will be available to be rolled out by the community after successful proposals accepted by the DAO;  
* Bonus skin addons after reaching Tree max age - Shiny Rainbow, Lonely Nimbus, Sus butterflies, Mini Rofls, Tech Rabbits, Sleepy Crescent, etc.;  
* +More.

?Gardening skill per action or per day?

**V. Seed\Tree UI**

Seed and Tree UI are the same.  

Seed\Tree UI includes:

 A) "Nurture" button;  
 B) "Loneliness" status;  
 C) "Tree rings" indicator;  
 D) "Jubilee" button;  
 E) "Shake the tree" button.  

A) **"Nurture"** button:

Nurture is a process of tree caretaking. It's an action that grows your tree or keeps it sustained and fed. 

From seed germination to fully grown and well Aged Tree (that might become Timeless tree), the only thing that all of the Trees needed is Gotchi Gardners taking care of them.  
Gotchi Gardeners will take care of the Trees - feeding them with lifegiving alchemica, nurturing them and praying for healthy tree growth.  

Nurturing(Feeding) process in a few words:**Alchemica** cost + **Channeling ability burn** = 2 conditions that must to be met in order of your Seed or Tree got fed, and been grown, getting closer to the next stage of it's Age.  

To be able to **Nurture** the Tree you need to have:

1) **Gotchi** that is able to spend it's **channeling**;  
2) Enough of **alchemica** to Nurture the Tree.  

*Spending Gotchi channeling on the tree, burns only Channeling, **without** affecting Gotchi **kinship**.*

**Nurture button** timer **resets** at the same time as Gotchis channeling ability **at 00:00 UTC**.

When Gotchi Gardners are Nurturing the Trees, Trees consume the water, evaporate the rest from the ground and by breathing, then produce Nimbus by its vapours.  
Apeered Nimbus sees that Gotchi Gardener taking a well care of the Tree, Nimbus hapily dissapears. In the end your tree gains **1 "Tree ring"**.  
Also, Nurturing grows your **Gotchi Gardener skill +1 per Nurturing**.  

By Nurturing your tree, you are making your tree feel needed and loved, because without your attention your tree will feel lonely and will fall into **Loneliness**.  
Every Nurturing resets the timer of Tree **Loneliness**.

B) **Loneliness** status: 

Loneliness is a status of your Tree.     

If you are not taking care of your Tree in 96 hours, it becomes lonely.

**Loneliness** in a few words:

1) **Tree** that **arn't been Nurtured** getting lonely, and **starting it's timer** of Loneliness;  
2) **After** been lonely for **96 hours** your tree getting crippled by the lightning, and becomes useless(almost) stump.  

Lonely Tree attracts the nearest Nimbus that is passing by.  
While staying alone, without the Gotchi Gardener Nurturing it, Nimbus sticks around and absorbs the vapours of water, that lonely Tree producing by its breath.   
When Nimbus absorbs enough of water it starts to gain rage and gets upset that no one is bringing fresh water to the Tree.       
Such a feeling makes Nimbus feel bad and angry at the owner of the Tree.   
But by inability to control its emotions, Nimbus releases the lightning that strikes the Tree, burning it, crippling it and making it become a stump.   

C) **"Tree Rings"** indicator:

Tree ring is a number that indicates your Tree stage of growth.  
By reaching a certain limit of Tree Rings your tree will hit the cap of its current growth stage.    

After reaching its cap of current stage of growth on the particular tree, your tree needs to claim a new stage of its growth by an aging mechanic that is called as **"Jubilee"**.

D) **"Jubilee"** button:

From Seed to Timeless Trees - there are 7 age periods that could be claimed for trees after seed has been grown - Sprout, Sapling, Young Tree, Adult Tree, Elder Tree, Ancient Tree, Timeless Tree.

**Jubilee is** a celebration day for Trees owners and Gotchi Gardeners - **Age claiming time**.  
At this day Trees could get older by claiming it's reached age. It's the transitional moment of Trees going to the next stage of its growth.  
Tree owners are throwing parties to get the attention of the other Gotchi Gardeners in the matter of the Jubilee celebration.  
A Specific number of gotchis must stay on your parcel with the aging tree, in order to celebrate the Jubilee together.  

!?All the gotchis attending the party receiving +1 Gardening skill?!

**Jubilee** in few words:

1) Certain number of tree rings (max cap at the current age);  
2) Certain number of gotchis on your parcel at the time of Jubilee (age claiming).  

If two of this criterias are met, then you will be able to get to the new stage of tree growth, by claiming the age through Jubilee.

 *You will be able to continue Nurturing the tree, in case if you cannot gather the party for Jubilee age claiming, but no tree rings will be added, since the cap of the tree growth couldn't be passed through.*

Every Age of the Tree has its own graphical design. 

!?Do we set up party channeling spendings on Jubilee?! 

E) **Shake the Tree** button:

Every Gotchi Gardener is feeling blessed and excited about the harvest that's worthy of its deeds.  
To obtain the rewards, including tree seed, Gotchi Gardner needs to come to the Tree, and shake it in order to try its luck.  
**Shake the Tree** is a VRF call, using the formula of Gardening skill per wallet, calculating your total efforts and failures that have been made by you, as a Gardener.You are able to click on the Harvest button any time, but keep in mind, that your Gardening skill affecting it's odds on reciving rewards succesfully.  

**VI. Gardening skill**

Gardening skills could give you:

Less gotchis needed to celebrate Jubilee (claim age)

Increase your odds on successful seed discovery in opened tree cone
