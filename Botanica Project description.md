# Botanica-project
Botanica is an ultimate update for Gotchiverse, with the unique gameplay and Alchemica utility sinks.

A) What is Botanica?
Botanica is the science about plants.

Plants is everything that grows - trees, herbs, fruit, veggies, berries and more.
(Trees will become our MVP in the matter of upcoming series of Gotchiverse Botanica updates.)
Any kind of your plants are grown on your parcel, where your parcel is your garden itself.

You can grow Trees, which are typically 2x2 size installations that comes from Seeds (Seed size is equal to it's grown Tree size). 
There are more sizes, depending on type of the Trees.

B) New installations, tiles utilities and unlimited soil tiles

All types of Botanica will be grown from the Seeds. Initially Seeds will come through Genesis cones event. 

Basically, Seeds and Trees, that will be grown out of it, are the same installation with the same UI. In order to start growing process your Seeds must to be placed on the parcel that covered with any tiles. For those who dont have any tiles, we are proposing to make new unlimited supply non-bazaar tradable Soil tiles that will be always on the sale in the DAO Maal (1x1 "Soil" tiles priced in 0.1-0.2 ghst).

C) Gameplay 

Seed and Tree UI is the same. 

It'll work opposite way to Altair, but the mechanic will near the same.

C.1) Placing the Seed and starting the growing process: 

Seed must to be in your wallet (or gotchi pocket, that you can deposit through the Aavegotchi protocol from your wallet). 

To place the Seed and to start its growing process, your parcel must to have any kind of tile covering it's surface, to work as a soil for the Seed and the future Tree.

Seed is predefined, how many “slots” it occupies to be placed on the parcel, as it defines the graphic space it occupies for the future Tree. Size of the Seed = size of the Tree

C.2) Feeding and growth processes:

Feeding process in few words:
Alchemica feeding price + Channeling ability burn = Your Seed or Tree got fed.

* Alchemica sink - Your gotchi is coming to the Seed or Tree, to fulfill the needs of your Seed or Tree (daily required alchemica price). 
* Reversed channeling process - While spending alchemica on feeding, Gotchis also burning it's channeling ability until the reset time. (This kind of action do not burn gotchi kinship\aka legacy channeling rule\. This kind of action do not give you any alchemica, your channeling ability burnt + alchemica spent.)  
* Each growing stage of Seed to become an Ancient Tree, will require different amount of alchemica and times of be fed\channeled (depends on the stage and types of Trees), that needs to be spent on the Tree. 
* This kind actions going to fill up the growing process bar. 
* By doing so your Gotchi will gain Gardening skill.  
* Gardening skill will give you a discount on the cost of growth, it's progress and Age claims.
