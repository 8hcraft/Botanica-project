# Botanica-project
Botanica update for Gotchiverse

A) What is Botanica?
Botanica is the science about plants.

Plants is everything that grows - trees, herbs, fruit, veggies and berries.

Your Botanica grown on your parcel, where your parcel is your garden.

Trees will become our MVP in this series of Gotchiverse update.

You can grow trees, which are typically 2x2 size installations from seeds (seeds will have the same sizes as trees). There are more sizes of trees with different color schemes.

B) New instalations and unlimited soil tiles

All types of Botanica will be grown from the seeds. Initial seed will come through Genesis cones distribution. 
Basically, seed and trees that will be grown out of it, are the same instalation. 

It'll work opposit way to altair, but the mechanic will be the same.

Seed and tree UI is the same. Each growing stage of seed to become an Ancient tree 

To place the seed your parcel must to have any kind of tile covering it's surface, to work as a soil.
For thouse who's dont have any tiles, we proposing to make new unlimited supply non-bazaar tradable soil tiles that will be always on the sale in the DAO Maal (1x1 tiles priced in ghst).

Your gotchi is coming to the seed, to feed it - daily required alchemica price, and with spending alchemica on it, with this action, Gotchi also spending it's channeling ability until the reset time. This kind of action do not burn gotchi kinship.
