# Botanica-project
Botanica is an ultimate update for Gotchiverse, with the unique gameplay and Alchemica utility sinks.

TL;DR

Mechanics of Botanica project implementation and it's benefits to Gotchiverse:

* Alchemica sink - Your gotchi is coming to the Seed or Tree, to fulfill the needs of your Seed or Tree (daily required alchemica price). 
* Reversed channeling process - While spending alchemica on feeding, Gotchis also burning it's channeling ability until the reset time, by interacting with tree. (This kind of action do not burn gotchi kinship\aka legacy channeling rule\. This kind of action do not give you any alchemica, your channeling ability burnt + alchemica spent.)  
* Tree feeding process is acting the same way as Gotchis reseting channeling ability = Your tree can be fed anytime in 24 hrs.
* Tree feeding timer get a reset ant the same time as gotchis getting channeling ability reset, 00.00 UTC.
* Each growing stage of Seed to become a Timeless Tree, will require different amount of alchemica and times of be fed (depends on the stage and types of Trees), that needs to be spent on the Tree. 
* This kind actions going to fill up the growing process bar which is conts in "tree rings". 
* By doing so your Gotchi will gain Gardening skill.  
* Gardening skill will give you a discount on the cost on growth and incresing your odds on succesful reward claims. 

**I) What is Botanica?**

Botanica is the science about *Plants*.
Plants is everything that grows from the soil - ***Trees** , herbs, fruits and berries, veggies and mushrooms*.

(**Trees** will become our MVP in the matter of upcoming series of Gotchiverse Botanica updates.)

All kinds of plants are grown on your parcel - your parcel is your garden itself. In the future we might go beyond the borders of our parcels and embellish entire Gotchiverse and it's streets.

Size of the Seed = size of the Tree. (Seed=Tree)
Trees and Seed are commonly 2x2 sized installations, but it's all depends on the type of Seeds\Trees.

**II) Botanica distribution**

All types of Botanica will be grown from the Seeds. Initially Seeds will come through "Genesis cones" distribution event. 

Botanica distribution:

Botanica will be distributed via Genesis cones distribution event.
Genesis cones will be airdroped to all of holders of the main assets, such as gotchis and parcels. 

Proportions of distribution per asset will be announced later.
All Genesis cones will have even odds for a success to obtain seeds.

**III) Tiles utilities for planting Seeds**

In order to start growing process your Seeds must to be planted on the parcel. 

Seed must to be in your *gotchi pocket*, that you can deposit through the Aavegotchi protocol from your wallet. 

In Gotchiverse, seed will appear in your **Building mode** same as any instalation.

To start growing your Seeds, your **parcel** must to **have** any kind of **tile covering it's surface**, to work as a soild surface for the Seed and the future Tree.
Before placing the Seed on the tile, think wisely, because after you place the seed on it, tile will loose it's ability to be moved (seed is "glued" to it).

**IV) Infinity items of Maal**

For those who dont have any tiles, we are proposing to make new, unlimited supply, non-bazaar tradable Soil tiles, that will be always on the sale in the DAO Maal (1x1 "Soil" tiles priced in 0.05 ghst).
Since it's imposible to move or unequip planted Seed or Tree, that been placed on the tiled parcel, you need **Gardening instruments**.

List of the proposed instruments for Gardening:

* Pair of gloves - Item that's needed for any kind of earthwork;
* Forest Axe - Axe that can cut down the grown tree;
* Midget pickaxe - Instrument that is used to destroy the seed;
* Light shovel - Tool to dig out the Seed(or Shrubs in the future);
* Shiny shovel - Tool to dig out the Tree or Stump;
* Roots remover - Tool to remove the roots of grown seeds, sprouts and saplings after it's excavations;
* Grubber - Heavy tool to remove roots of grown Trees or Stumps after it's excavations;

* **+More

After destroying the Seed or the Tree, you will be able to do anything with the tile underneath.
If destruction of the plant is not an option, you can buy "shiny shovel" and "Pair of gloves gloves" in the maal in order to dig it up and move. 

Each of the Maal **Gardening item** have 1 time use per action and after using it, it will be destroyed (nft burn).

**V) Gameplay**
A) Planting seeds and growing process
B) Seed\Tree UI
ะก) 

C.1) 

C.2) Seed\Tree UI

Seed and Tree UI is the same. 

Seed\Tree UI includes:

"Nurture" button = process of feeding your tree.

Nurturing(Feeding) process in few words:
Alchemica cost + Channeling ability burn = 2 conditions that must to be met in order of your Seed or Tree got fed.

It'll work opposite way to Altair. The mechanics will be near the same, just reversed.

C.3) Aging and claims of aging Trees - Jubilee 

From seed to sapling, the only thing that Gotchi Gardners need, is a care that they give to the trees - feeding it's with alchemica and pray for the healthy tree growth (Alchemica+Channeling burn).
   
Only Trees will be able to have a special ability to be aged in Botanica update. 
After continuosly care giving actions by your Gotchi Gardners, Trees will accumulate your Love, and at some point will be able to change it's form to the Older version.
